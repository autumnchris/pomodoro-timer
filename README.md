My project for the [Build a Pomodoro Clock challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock) as part of the curriculum for the Front End Development Certification on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## User Stories
1. I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
